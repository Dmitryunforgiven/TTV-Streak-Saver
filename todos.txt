1 - fix close_browser() function in case the stream ends and there are still some tabs opened by a user.
    (curently it cannot properly identify the page it opened to close it, throws an error in logs:
    selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchWindowException: Message: no such window: target window already closed
    from unknown error: web view not found
    )
2 - add handler for a stream error which requires to press the button or reload the page.
3 - add an apiless mode that is going to check the stream status using selenium and chrome in headless mode.
4 - add a simple ui that would allow to select the needed channel to monitor from the list of followed channels.
5 - add support for muli channel monitoring / points farming.
